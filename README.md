We analyzed store data using pivot tables and Dax measures to answer critical questions and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales and profit. Using MS Excel,

we created an interactive dashboard to visualize these insights. 

**The dashboard is separated into three sections.**
**There is a hyperlink that connects all sheets.** 

* The first section contains important information regarding this store, such as total sales, total profit, number of branches, number of orders, number of products,quantities sold per each product, and so on. 

* The second section provides more extensive descriptive analysis of the movement of sales across dates, distributions, categories, and top products sold. 

* The final section delves deeper into the profit, margin of profit, profit over dates, distributions, categories, and the top products in profit.
